        If the thermostat in your dryer is faulty, this can also lead to heating problems.
         The thermostat controls the temperature inside the dryer, and if it is broken, the heating element may not work properly.

        The thermal fuse is a device that protects the dryer from overheating. If it fails, this can lead to insufficient heating of the dryer.
