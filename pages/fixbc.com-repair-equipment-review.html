    <h1>Is it worth fixing a 7 years old washing machine?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>I will say first of all, what do you think about ordering me a washing machine repair and is it of value? If the washing machine is 7 years old or 8 years old or 9 years old or 2 years old I rely on my own experience at 16 years old.
          Quite a lot of repair experience I have gained, as I have dealt with models such as LG, whirlpool, samsung, admiral, kitchenid, bosh, miele, mytag, blomberg, GE, these are just some of the most popular brands we have repaired and continue to service,
          we repair the most popular models and all appliances, our experience will help you fix the best washer or dryer. There is value in fixing any appliance is a valid answer that we can answer,
          I will explain why to you - 1 - if the washer looks great and there are no rusty parts on the outside and the washer has been running for 2 or 4 years or 20 years yes even 20 year old washers and dryers come to us for repair,
           how do you think after the repair of the washer and dryer?</li>
      
        <li>After our visit and a professional technician who will service your household appliances, it will definitely work for 3 years or more, and who knows.
        If before the repair, the dryer and washing machine were not serviced for 20 years, and it worked and dried, washed your clothes without any breakdowns, perhaps it will work longer
        if everything is checked correctly and serviced properly, before, household appliances were built in high quality, and it makes sense to fix it, and enjoy using it further without any problems,
        </li>
      
        <li>Nowadays, there are different models that have passed the warranty of dryers and washing machines, they get repaired after a year or 2 years, it all depends on how intensively you use household appliances
        in your home and whether you call a technician every 3 years or 5 years to service the washer dryer, my advice to you is up to you, if you have a lot of money, then you can just buy new household appliances,
        I am simply explaining our experience related to household appliances. I can compare this with any car you drive, it will also require maintenance after a while, and some models require a long period of maintenance,
        so and in short my opinion about repairing a washing machine and dryer, this is a review.
        </li>
        <h2>What is the best washing machine brand?</h2>
      
        <li> I believe that the best washing machine of the year may not be just one model,
         having encountered many washing machines, we found out that you are looking for
         a washing machine for a long time to use for yourself,
         or you are just considering that the washing machine has good functions but the service life is shorter. 
         You need to think about these questions.</li>
       <h2> What is the best washing machine?</h2>
        <li> 1 >>>
         Reviews fixbc.com Alex Vancouver.
         1 - I can give you feedback on how to choose a model and the right sizes.
         Let's take the smallest sizes of washing machine and dryer - this is Bloomberg washing machine - dryer,
         this is a reputable brand that will work for a long time, and German technology
         tells us about the quality of these household appliances - it is very convenient
         if you have little space inside your apartment, the price is also good and the quality is good.
        </li>
      
        <li> 2 >>>
        I will also describe maytag good washing machines with a capacity of up to 13 kg
        of laundry, a very high quality model, also the size is large for a large family,
        the quality of washing is excellent, the quality of operation is very good.
      </li>
      
        <li> 3 >>>
         I will also briefly describe the Samsung washing machine.
         A good model that has proven its quality since 1990,
         Japanese technology has also been tested by us, it has a 13 kg load of laundry,
         the outside is beautiful, there are many washing programs and also a stitching program for washing.
        </li>
      
        <li> 4 >>>
         I will also describe the whirlpool commercial washing machine model which has a relatively small load
         of laundry, but the advantage is that it has a coin acceptor, is suitable for dorms, the quality is excellent,
         it can wash 6 washes a day and can handle high loads more.</li>
        
      </ul>

    <p>All these models <b>GE</b>, <b>Whirpool</b>,<b>Maytage</b> have similar problems, this happens when we wash our clothes, at some sudden moment at the end of washing the clothes are left wet with water, this is a very big problem.<p> The washing machine receives a very heavy load while doing the washing, especially when inside your clothes, but if you put the <b>GE</b>washing machine in, the washing machine receives twice as much load.<h3>GE washer stops mid cycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>GE washer stops mid cycle what to do?</b></li>
    </ul>
    </p> So the washing machine may leave water inside the <strong>washing machine not drain</strong>, be careful and collect all the water with a plastic cup, if after restarting a new washing program it It happened again and there is water inside the washing machine.<b>How to get maytage washer to drain </b>GE,Whirpool, It’s better to call us and not kill the washing machine; as a result of an overload, the control board may burn out, it is subject to loads from the electrical network, or some other problem</p>
