            <p>
                The Kenmore Elite dryer is a quality, reliable device that can serve you for many years.
                However, like any other household appliance, it can encounter problems and break down. Important to remember,
                that Kenmore Elite dryer repair.
               
               After repairs, the dryer can continue to operate for a long time.
                However, the exact duration of work after repair depends on several factors, such as the quality of the repair,
                the condition and age of the machine, as well as the intensity of its use.
            </p><hr>
            <p>
                The condition and age of your dryer will also affect its longevity after repair.
                If the machine is already in poor condition or has significant wear and tear, even after repair, its service life may be limited.
                 In such cases, repairs may be a temporary solution and a machine replacement or repair will be required in the future after about 3 years.
                <br>
                <hr>
                Intensity of use is also important in determining how long a dryer will last after repair.
                 If the machine is used only occasionally, it will be less likely to break down after repair and will be able to work longer.
                 However, if the machine is used intensively, then its wear and tear will be higher, which means the likelihood of breakdown after repair increases.
                In general, a dryer, once properly repaired, can continue to operate for a long time,
            </p>
