        <h1>GE refrigerator door gasket replacement.</h1>
        <p>We can also replace the seal on Samsung, Maytag, Whirlpool, Sab-zero, Frigidaire, Kenmore. <b>6043795918</b>
        In general, we can replace the refrigerator gasket on any refrigerator; our experience of 14 years is enough for this service.
        You can also order refrigerator gasket replacement from us in Burnaby, Vancouver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>The gasket on the refrigerator is cracked.</h2>
        <img class="imgFridge" src="../img/Repair gasket fridge-Vancouver.jpg" alt="Repair gasket fridge">
        <p>In Sab-zero refrigerators, sometimes you can observe the creation of ice and snow and icicles. This not only worsens its operation but also creates additional inconveniences and issues.
        The main cause of this phenomenon is the loose closing of the door, but there may be other reasons as well, causing warm air to get inside.
        When this air interacts with the cold contained in the refrigerator, it condenses and freezes, forming snow and ice formations. 
        Over time, this can prevent the cold air from circulating properly, causing increased energy consumption and possible damage to the compressor.
        The temperature may also rise. If you notice the temperature in the refrigerator rising, a tip is not to lower the temperature on the panel - you may damage the control board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>The door on the refrigerator does not close</h2>
        <p>The Samsung refrigerator door rubber is one of the most important elements of the door that ensures the tightness of the device.
        However, over time, it may start to tear or lose its properties.
        The reasons for this phenomenon are diverse and are often associated with improper use or manufacturing defects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Causes of cracks in refrigerator gasket.</h2>
        <p>One of the main reasons why the rubber band can tear is mechanical damage.
        This often occurs as a result of constant opening and closing of the door,
        especially if the refrigerator is not used carefully: the rubber band may get pinched or be subjected to excessive tension, or the door may sag and not close properly.
        Also, very often there is damage and cracking of the coating of the rubber band itself; after that, from the tension, it tears. Experience shows that water gets under the rubber band and over time spoils the material itself; usually, it happens after 5 years of operation.
        But some refrigerators with rubber bands on the doors work for more than 10 years, and the rubber band on the door looks great, almost like new.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Reasons why the refrigerator does not close.</h3>
        <p>Another reason is temperature fluctuations affecting the material of rubber bands.
        Elastomeric materials can lose their elasticity with sudden changes in temperature or humidity,
        becoming more brittle and prone to damage.</p>
        
       <p> Improper cleaning or use of aggressive chemicals can also lead to the destruction of the rubber band.
        So, to prolong the life of the refrigerator door rubber, it is important to be careful in its use and take care of its condition,
        choosing only safe cleaning products.</p>
        
       <p> One of the most effective solutions to this problem is refrigerator door rubber band replacement in Vancouver.
        Over time,time, the GE rubber loses its elastic properties, begins to crack or wear out, which leads to cold leaks.
        Installing a new, quality rubber band will eliminate the gaps through which warm air is leaking in,
        and restore proper operation of the unit. By saving energy and preventing ice buildup,
        you will not only extend the life of your refrigerator but also ensure its efficient operation.</p>
